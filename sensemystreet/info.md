**SenseMyStreet** is part of the community toolbox in [The Internet of Caring Things (IoCT)](https://ioct.uknica.co.uk/") at [The National Innovation Centre for Ageing (NICA)](https://uknica.co.uk/). It enables communities to commission sensors from the [Urban Observatory](http://www.urbanobservatory.ac.uk/) and locate them on their streets, collecting evidence to inform or even change their communities. For the first time, the public has access to precision sensing equipment to enable them to gather data that is relevant to their local issues.
